## Summary

#### dependencies:
- For the project structure used https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout
- Used [go-kit/kit](https://gokit.io/) for the writing the tickers/login services it lays out a good foundation for writing microservices in go. with the use of 3 layers (transport, endpoint, service) it makes it easy to add new transports (grpc, http, etc).
- Used [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) as the http router, it's a lightweight router that has a lot of features.
- Used [Zap Logger](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) for logging, almost no logging is done but it's there.
- Used [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)/[Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for CLI/Configuration

#### code structure:
- The main logic for tickers is in `./internal/tickers`
- The main logic for login is in `./internal/login`
- Additional helper/shared code is in `./internal/pkg`
- The cli entrypoint is in `./cmd/main.go`
